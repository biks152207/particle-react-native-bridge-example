# Particle SDK - React Native bridge

A React Native integration for the [Particle iOS SDK](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/).

Using this basic app as an example, you should be able to integrate the setup process of Particle-powered products into your own React Native app.

## Prerequisites

You will need node.js, Watchman, the command line interface for React Native, and Xcode installed.

Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) (Building projects with Native Code) to ensure these are all correctly installed.

## Running the app

    $ git clone https://github.com/pixielabs/particle-react-native-bridge-example.git
    $ cd particle-react-native-bridge-example
    $ yarn
    $ react-native run-ios
