# Particle SDK - React Native bridge

A React Native integration for the [Particle iOS SDK](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/intro/photon/).

Using this basic app as an example, you should be able to integrate the setup process of Particle-powered products into your own React Native app.

## Running the sample app

    $ git clone https://github.com/pixielabs/particle-react-native-bridge-example.git
    $ cd particle-react-native-bridge-example
    $ yarn
    $ react-native run-ios
